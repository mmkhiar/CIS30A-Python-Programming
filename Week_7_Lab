# 1. Total Sales
# Design a program that asks the user to enter a store's sales
# for each day of the week.
# The amounts should be stored in a list. Use a loop to calculate the total sales
# for the total sales for the week and display the results

# 2. Lottery Number Generator
# Design a program that generates a seven-digit lottery number. The program should generate seven random numbers, each in the range of 0 through 9,
# and assign each a number to a list element. (Random numbers were discussed in Chapter 5.) Then write another loop that displays the contents of the list

import random

# 3. Rainfall Statistics
# Design a program that lets the user enter the total rainfall for each of 12 months into a list.
# The program should calculate and display the total rainfall for the year, the average monthly rainfall, the months with the highest and lowest amounts.

# 4. Number Analysis Program
# Design a program that asks the user to enter a series of 20 numbers. The program should store the numbers in a list
# then display the following data:
# The lowest number in the list
# The highest number in the list
# The total of the number in the list
# The average of the numbers in the list

# 6. Larger than N
# In a program, write a function that accepts two arguments: a list, and a number N.
# Assume that the list contains numbers. The function should display all of the numbers in the list that are greater than the number N
