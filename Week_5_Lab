# Week 5 Programming Exercise ##

# 1. the Kilometer Converter Problem
# This program asks the user a distance in kilometers and then uses a functiono to convert that distance to miles.

Conversion_factor=0.6214
#This function ask the user how many kilometers they want converted
def main():
    Kilometers=float(input("Enter a distance in Kilometers: "))

def show_miles(km):
    Miles=km*Conversion_factor
    print(f"{km} kilometers equals {Miles} miles")

# 7. Paint Job Estimator
# This program asks the user to enter the square feet of wall space to be painted and the price per gallon.
# The company determined that for every 112 sqrft, one gallon of paint and 8 hours of labor will be rerquired.
# The program should display the following data:

# The hours of labor required
# The cost of the paint
# The labor charges
# The total cost of the paint job
