### Question 1: File Processing and Data Analysis
### Write a Python program that reads a text file named grades.txt, where each line contains a student's name followed by their grade (e.g., Alice 88).
### The program should:
### 1. Calculate the average grade.
### 2. Count the number of students who scored above the average.
### 3. Write the average and the count of above-average students to a file named results.txt

student_count=0
grade_sum=0
grade_list = []
above_average_count = 0
grade_file=open('C:/Users/MUN/Desktop/Desktop_Misc/Python_Scripts/grades.txt', 'r')

for line in grade_file:
    name, grade = line.split()
    grade_list.append((name, int(grade)))
    student_count+=1
    grade_sum=grade_sum+int(grade)

average_grade = grade_sum / student_count

for name, grade in grade_list:
    if grade > average_grade:
        above_average_count += 1

with open('results.txt', 'w') as result:
    result.write(f'The average grade for the class is: {average_grade:.2f}%\n')
    result.write(f'The amount of students that are above the average is: {above_average_count}\n')

### Question 2: Data Transformation
### Write a Python function called transform_data that accepts a list of integers. The function should:
### 1. Create a new list containing each integer from the original list squared.
### 2. Calculate the sum of the squared values.
### 3. Return both the new list and the sum.

test_list_01= [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
test_list_02= [2,1,2,8,4,5,6,7,2,9,130]
test_list_03= [5,1,7,8,4,3,6,4,2,8,30]
## I have provided three lists above for testing purposes.

def transform_data(list):
    squared_list=[]
    for num in list:
        squared_number=num**2
        squared_list.append(squared_number)
    total_sum=sum(squared_list)
    print(f"The squared values of the list are as follows: {squared_list}\n")
    print(f"The sum of the squares of the list is: {total_sum}\n")

## Below is where we call the function. To test out the other lists, switch out the list in the function parameter parentheses.
transform_data(test_list_01)
